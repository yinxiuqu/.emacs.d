;;; Commentary:

;; Per-buffer recent edit history tracking for minuet-duet.
;;
;; Enable `minuet-duet-history-mode' in a buffer to record the user's
;; recent edits as unified diffs.  Nothing runs per keystroke: each
;; tracked buffer owns a one-shot idle timer that detects changes by
;; comparing `buffer-chars-modified-tick' against the last snapshot's
;; tick and then schedules the buffer's next check, so all tracking
;; state is buffer-local.  Snapshots are temporary files under a
;; shared session directory (deleted at `kill-emacs') written with
;; `write-region' (no Lisp string is allocated), and the diff is
;; computed asynchronously by an external program
;; (`minuet-duet-history-diff-program', by default diff, or `git diff
;; --no-index' on native Windows without diff on PATH), producing one
;; coalesced history entry per editing burst.
;; `minuet-duet--build-context' calls `minuet-duet-history-flush',
;; which waits for the in-flight diff up to
;; `minuet-duet-history-flush-timeout' seconds, so the burst typed
;; right before a prediction is normally included; past the deadline
;; the prompt is built with history one burst stale instead of
;; blocking.  The formatted history is included via
;; `minuet-duet-history-prompt-text'.
